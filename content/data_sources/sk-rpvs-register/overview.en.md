In 2017, the Act on the Register of Public Sector Partners (ARPSP) entered into
force in Slovakia. It covers entities benefiting from public funding or
conducting business with the state, so-called ‘Partners of Public Sector’. Data
is collected by the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic in the ‘Register
partnerov verejného sektora’ (RPVS), which is free to use and public. This is
the data which is available on the OpenOwnership register.

Following an amendment of the Anti-money Laundering Act, and under the
amendments to the Commercial Register Act, all companies are now obliged to
register their beneficial owners to the Commercial Register by 31 December 2019.
Unlike the RPVS, the data will not be made public and access will be limited to
persons and authorities provided for by law.

## Direct and indirect ownership

Slovak companies and foreign companies operating in Slovakia have to report
beneficial owners (‘Konečného užívateľa výhod’) who directly and indirectly
control a company. Beneficial owners can be Slovak or foreign natural persons.
Declarations to the RPVS must be done via an ‘authorized person’, who must be
either an attorney, notary, bank, auditor or a tax advisor.

A beneficial owner is a natural person who:

- holds (directly or indirectly) at least 25% of the voting rights or a 25%
  share in the registered capital of the legal entity
- has the right to appoint or recall a statutory/executive/supervisory body of
  the legal entity or any of its members
- controls in practice a legal entity other than as described above
- has at least a 25% share of the benefits from the legal entity’s business
  (dividends and similar payments)

If a beneficial owner’s interests are held indirectly through one or more legal
entities (whether Slovak or foreign), they have to be declared.

This is because legal entities, such as companies and trusts, can never be
beneficial owners, only natural persons can.

If there are no persons who meet the above criteria, members of senior
management of the company are considered to be beneficial owners.

## Exclusions and exemptions

In the RPVS, information regarding beneficial owners of all entities conducting
business with the state have to be registered. There are no exemptions such as
foreign entities acting through branch offices, non-profits or contractual
partnerships. However since September 2019, any company owned directly or
indirectly by a listed company (on a regulated market or a market with similar
disclosure obligations in accordance with applicable EU regulation) only needs
to report the executive directors and board members of this parent company.

In the Commercial Register, listed companies are exempt altogether.

Registration in the RPVS removes the obligation to register in the Commercial
Register, however the opposite is not true.
