            This page is a catalogue of the major changes we have made to the
            data in this Register, in particular to the data available for bulk
            download in BODS format.
          %p
            Each entry is a dated set of changes, with an explanation of the
            changes that were made and any implications they may have for you
            as a user of our data. Where possible, we'll identify directly
            which releases of bulk data you'll see these changes in.

                After a report of duplicate identifiers for UK companies in our
                output we investigated and realised that we were assigning some
                company numbers under the wrong identifier scheme. We were also
                missing an opportunity to output the internal "self link"
                identifier that Companies House give to Relevant Legal Entities
                (i.e. intermediate or ultimate corporate owners).
              %p
                This affects approximately 28,000 companies from the UK PSC data
                that were reported as owners of another company and where the
                disclosure included a 'registration number'. Before, we would
                output that registration number as a company number under the
                'GB-COH' scheme (when the company was declared as being in the
                UK jurisdiction). Now, we output it under a new named scheme
                "GB Persons Of Significant Control Register - Registration
                numbers" - to make it clear that the data is not verified and
                therefore not directly comparable to the GB-COH identifiers we
                output from the company numbers identifiying companies' own
                disclosures.
              %p
                In most cases, this simply means that we now output
                additional identifiers, because we'll also give one under the
                GB-COH scheme. For total accuracy, you should compare entities
                via the OpenOwnership register identifiers and remove GB-COH
                identifiers where they no longer appear in our data.
              %p
                In addition, we now output Companies House's internal
                'self link' identifiers for all owners, whether legal entity or
                natural person. We previously did this for all people, and legal
                entities that had no registration number or were not UK
                companies. You should simply see more identifiers for some UK
                companies.

              We now include a lot more identifiers in our bulk data output. As
              well as the existing identifiers for official registers, these
              should allow users to link entities to source data, OpenCorporates
              and back to the Register itself. See
              <a href="/download#identifiers">our documentation</a> for more
              information.
            %li
              We now correctly set <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code>
              values in <code>interests</code> when we have an
              <code>exact</code> value. A small change but one that makes us
              more compliant with BODS.

              We now include foreign companies from the Slovakian Public Sector
              Partners Register (Register partnerov verejn√©ho sektora) where
              previously we skipped them. This means we have around 1,000 new
              companies and their owners, and in a few hundred cases, these are
              also linked to entries in other registers.
            %li
              We've improved how we identify foreign companies in Slovakian
              data. This means that some SK companies have changed jurisdiction
              to other countries, and often we can now match those companies to
              OpenCorporates where we couldn't before.

              We're now regularly importing data from the Ukrainian United State
              Register of Legal Entities, meaning Ukrainian data is up to date,
              not just a one-off import from 2018.

              Our data is now openly-licensed as ODC-BY, requiring only
              attribution, rather than ODBL which imposed a 'share-alike'
              condition.
