            We have <a href="http://standard.openownership.org/en/v0-1/">
            extensive documentation on the standard</a>, in particular we
            recommend understanding the <a href="http://standard.openownership.org/en/v0-1/schema/concepts.html">
            key concepts in the data model</a> and then referring to the

            <strong>Our regular data updates occur every three weeks</strong>, and we will
            endeavour to make a new export after each update. This page will be
            updated as soon as that happens, but you can also rely on the

            <strong>A comprehensive dataset of <i>companies</i> in the jurisdictions
            we have data for</strong>. It only contains those people and companies who've
            declared beneficial ownership information. For example, the UK PSC
            and DK CVR registers are broadly intended to cover all companies in
            their respective countries, but there will always be companies who
            don't comply. In addition, some jurisdictions (e.g. Slovakia)
            only require declarations from specific sectors or types of
            companies.
          %p
            <strong>Data on company directors, officials or shareholders</strong>. Whilst
            individuals in these roles may also be beneficial owners, the
            inverse is not always true. The people in our data are only those
            who meet the definition of a beneficial owner in their respective
            jurisdiction. There are often thresholds of share-holding (for
            example) which must be exceeded to qualify. Conversely,
            share-holding is not the only way one becomes a beneficial owner.
          %p
            <strong>A complete BODS representation of the Register's dataset</strong>. As you'll see
            from <a href="http://standard.openownership.org/en/v0-1/schema/schema-browser.html">
            the documentation</a>, BODS' schema provides fields for lots of
            data. We try to map the Register's data to this model as fully as
            possible, but there is data we don't have because it's not
            provided in our sources and data we haven't mapped fully yet.

          %p
            In particular, we're aware of the following omissions and issues:
          %p
            %button.btn.btn-primary{ data: { toggle: "collapse", target: "#caveats" } }
              Expand issues &nbsp;<i class="fa fa-plus"></i>
          %ul.collapse{ id: 'caveats' }
            %li
              The data is in v0.1 of the data standard, not the most recent
              v0.2. We're working on updating this.
            %li
              We're not making incremental updates and marking old statements
              via <code>replacesStatements</code> fields. Each update is a
              standalone snapshot of the entire data set, although our
              <code>statementIDs</code> should be consistent where data
              doesn't change. We include BODS identifiers with the register's
              internal ID for each entity and person (along with any from the
              source data and OpenCorporates) to help you de-dupe statements.
            %li
              Because we try to reconcile every company with OpenCorporates, the
              data you see may not have actually come from the source. If we can
              match a company to OpenCorporates we prefer their data because it
              is normalised, cleaned and derived from more sources than ours. In
              particular this affects the company name, address, jurisdiction,
              company number, incorporation date, dissolution date and company
              type. We're aware of some issues where this causes a loss of data
              from the source and are working on plans to make the process more
              granular and transparent.
            %li
              We're not marking what type of <code>address</code> a person's address is,
              as this information is not available in our sources.
            %li
              We're not marking which specific <code>Interests</code>
              constitute beneficial ownership and which don't. We need to do
              more analysis on our sources to understand when it's possible
              to determine this.
            %li
              We only set <code>source</code> fields to report provenance on
              <code>ownershipOrControlStatements</code>, not
              <code>entityStatements</code> or <code>personStatements</code>.
              This is because of how, historically, the register has stored
              provenance information, but we're working on it.
            %li
              We don't set <code>statementDate</code>, because we don't have a
              dates available across our sources that is consistent with BODS'
              meaning of this field. We need to do more work to understand when
              we can report this accurately.
            %li
              We currently report all entities as <code>registeredEntity</code>
              even when they're obviously not, such as the state which owns
              state-owned entities.
            %li
              We don't have any data to be able to report <code>placeOfBirth</code>,
              <code>placeOfResidence</code>, <code>pepStatus</code> or
              <code>deathDate</code> for people, nor <code>alternateNames</code>
              for companies.

          %h2{ id: 'how-to-use-it' } How do I use it?
          %p
            While we suggest you read the <a href="http://standard.openownership.org/en/v0-1/">
            Beneficial Ownership Data Standard documentation</a>, here's a very
            brief overview of how the data is structured and how we suggest
            you can use it:
          %h3{ id: 'format' } Format & Structure
          %p
            As mentioned above, the file is a single JSONLines format file,
            with one JSON <code>statement</code> per line. Lines are
            separated by Unix line endings (<code>\n</code>). The file has been
            compressed with Gzip, so expect the uncompressed version to be
            roughly 10x bigger than the compressed one.
          %p
            Each statement concerns a person, entity or relationship between
            them. They are in order such that, if you process the file
            sequentially from first line to last, you will see the people or
            entities involved in any relationships <i>before</i> you see the
            relationships. Note that this means if you process the file in a
            parallel or distributed fashion, you will need a means of
            revisiting statements which you see out of order.
